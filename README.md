Business Question - In order to help a company identify the optimal amount of product to produce, we have been tasked to find the best 3 models to predict future sales for the company.
This project is similar to that of the Mansfield Sales Predictions, but holds a few more layers, such as more intensive feature and model selection.  

An Applied Machine Learning group final project, lead by myself along with 2 others in December 2022.

Completed fully using Python within Jupyter Notebook.
